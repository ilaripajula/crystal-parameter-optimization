# crystal-parameter-optimization
This project first aims to propose a reliable evaluation criterion of the curve fitting quality by Matlab or Python. The development of an efficient and automatic parameter calibration process based on the Finnish CSC platform is the second objective. 

Main tasks: 

 - Literature review about fitting quality evaluation and parameter optimization approaches. 

 - Development of the evaluation criteria of curve fitting quality. 

 - Automatic control of CP simulation on the CSC platform. 

 - Program-driven control of CP parameter optimization.
