# crystal-parameter-optimization
This project first aims to develop an efficient and automatic material parameter calibration process based on DAMASK running on the Finnish CSC platform. 

Main tasks: 

 - Literature review about fitting quality evaluation and parameter optimization approaches. 

 - Development of the evaluation criteria of curve fitting quality. 

 - Automatic control of CP simulation on the CSC platform. 

 - Program-driven control of CP parameter optimization.
